        To offer a little detail about myself, I thought it best to provide this essay I wrote to describe my goals as an engineer:
        
        <div id="essay">
            In a trade school, one's primary focus is acquiring skills with a direct application that is broadly needed. No matter where you go, the world always needs carpenters, plumbers, and other such tradesmen—the infrastructure of the physical world depends on it. The more I see of engineering, the more I see that something similar is true of engineering: the word—the infrastructure of the industrial, scientific, and digital worlds depend on it. Take the spread of computers for example: over the past few decades, the word computer has gone from a job description to a novelty and a workplace tool, to now the thing that controls your car, your fridge, and everything in between. And the same is true for a number of other less well-known but just as prevalent technologies—and behind each of them are the engineers who design, implement, and maintain them. 
            Examining the list of titles often placed in front of engineer, one finds a continually expanding list: from the more conventional mechanical and industrial engineers to the more exotic nuclear and robotics engineers—to say nothing of the myriad subfields such as spacecraft design and nuclear medicine. Even as I intend to major specifically in computer science I still have a wide array of options, from web development to cryptography, AI to quantum computing, and new fields that haven't fully emerged yet. But no matter the choice, I know my work will bring a positive impact. While the political world does as it pleases and the business world pursues its own ends, the world of engineers marches on continuing to solve problems. There's a reason why science fiction captures our imagination in a way that other genres cannot, a reason why we watch films like Interstellar with the same awe as the real moon landing, a reason why Silicon Valley has stars and icons that rival their political and cinematic counterparts: because time and again engineers produce genuinely spectacular results. Trains became cars, cars became jets, and soon after jets became rockets not bound to earth. Computers, once the size of a warehouse and with vacuum tubes sprawling all about, now fit in our pockets and help organize almost all of our daily life.
            But beyond these more glamorous advances, engineers contribute to another essential task that—like much of the work of plumbers and carpenters—is much more subtle, but just as necessary: maintenance. Every time something in our house breaks—a pipe leaks and bursts, a floor needs to be replaced—an army of tradesmen stand at the ready to competently fix the problem. And because of them, daily life as we know it remains possible. While the engineer may not be as visible in his work, he too helps provide the maintenance on which society increasingly depends. Every time a computer crashes or the power grid goes down, engineers are there to solve the problem. For every small bug that makes its way to the public, hundreds of critical issues are caught and dealt with, long before someone's data is stolen, long before the bridge is built, long before someone's life is at risk. Every project that is built—whether routing pipes or routing circuits—must also be maintained, and though this fact is often overlooked it is not to be forgotten.
            That is why I am glad to call myself an engineer—among the ranks of those maintaining the present and building the future no matter where we go.
